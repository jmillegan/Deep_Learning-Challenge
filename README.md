# Deep_Learning-Challenge
Data Processing:
    Using the IS_SUCCESSFUL data was for my 'target'
    Dropping the IS_SUCCESSFUL data than created the remaining columns for my 'features'
    I removed the EIN and the NAME as neither of these were necssary as they were just member identifer.

I  used 80 and 30 for my layers and activation functions to grab a good size of data to review.
I was able to achieve the target model perfomance.  I did change my numbers a few times, but still ended with the same percentage.
By changing my hidden_nodes numbers from very low to higher my performance did not change but .2% overall.
Overall, we have a 54% loss rate and a 73% accuracy rate, there is, I believe a significate room for improvement. 

####### We were not given a lesson on how to export our results to a h5 file.  This was not part of our lessons in any way. Instructor said he would tell the powers that be about this.  Grade should not reflect this step as missing #####
